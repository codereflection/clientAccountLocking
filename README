Test in having a singleton manage state for locking
a client account for processing in a web service.

A client account is just a simple class with an id.

The idea is that only one web service call can process
a given client account at a time. If a second call to 
a web service method is made, an exception should be 
thrown stating that the client account is already locked
for processing.
